Specification Compliance Tests for AWS Lambda tracing
=====================================================

This integration test suite is basically a duplicate of
https://github.ibm.com/instana/tracer-test-suite/tree/main/test-suite. The tests are driven by the file
[packages/collector/test/tracing/misc/specification_compliance/tracer_compliance_test_cases.json](/packages/collector/test/tracing/misc/specification_compliance/tracer_compliance_test_cases.json), which is itself a copy of
https://github.ibm.com/instana/tracer-test-suite/blob/main/test-cases/tracer_compliance_test_cases.json.

See [packages/collector/test/tracing/misc/specification_compliance/README.md](/packages/collector/test/tracing/misc/specification_compliance/README.md)
for more details.
