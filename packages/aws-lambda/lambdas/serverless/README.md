# Serverless/Webpack Test Lambda

* Build package: `npm run build` (or `serverless package`)
* Build and deploy (first deployment): `npm run deploy-initial` (or `sls deploy`)
* Build and deploy (a bit faster, after initial deploy): `npm run deploy` (or `sls deploy function -f serverless-webpack-test`)
